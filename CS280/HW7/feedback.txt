100 points total

Graph that I am testing on (I add each of these cities/edges):
A-->C(3) B(2) 
B-->A(2) D(3) 
C-->A(3) F(6) 
D-->B(3) E(4) 
E-->D(4) 
F-->C(6) 

I run a BFT starting at A
Expecting something like: A C B F D E 

I run a DFT starting at A
Expecting something like: A B D E C F 

I run a shortest path (Dijkstra's) from A to E
Expecting something like: 
Dijstra's returned a path of weight 9 from a to e
Path: a b d e 
---------------------------------------

Destructor (3/5 points) -- need to delete adjacent vertices as well

Inserting a vertex (10/10 points)

Inserting an edge (20/20 points):
	(/10 points): adds edge properly
	(/10 points): adds edge in both directions (algorithm is reasonable)

Searching (10/10 points)

BFT (10/10 points):
	(/8 points): implemented properly
	(/2 points): resets struct member variables after modifying

DFT (10/10 points):
	(/8 points): implemented properly
	(/2 points): resets struct member variables after modifying

Dijkstra's (0/20 points):
	(/10 points): algorithm implemented properly
	(/3 points): updates parent and distance appropriately
	(/4 points): shortest path function implemented properly
	(/3 points): resets all parents and distances in shortest path

Output matches my own (15/15 points):
	(5/5 points): Printing after adding all vertices/edges
	(5/5 points): BFT
	(5/5 points): DFT

TOTAL: (78/100)
