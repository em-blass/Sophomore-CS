100 points total

---------------------------------------

Problem 1.1 (10/10 points) Draw heap:
	(5/5 points): Draws a correct heap as tree
	(5/5 points): Draws a correct heap as array

Problem 1.2 (20/20 points) Heapify:
	(10/10 points): Starts in middle and works towards left
	(10/10 points): Follows heapify algorithm correctly

Problem 1.3 (10/10 points) why:
	(5/5 points) heaps preferable to RB trees
	(5/5 points) RB trees preferable to heaps

Problem 2.1 (10/10 points) Mergsort (visual):
	(5/5 points) splits list in half each time
	(5/5 points) merges elements from each recursive call correctly back into sorted list

Problem 2.1 (25/25 points) Mergesort (implemenation):
	(10/10 points): Splits list in half each iteration down to lists of size 1
	(10/10 points): Merge operation is performed correctly at each step
	(5/5 points): Code compiles and works

Problem 2.2 (10/10 points) Quicksort:
	(5/5 points): Provides an adequete example
	(5/5 points): Explanation about why this results in bad runtime

Problem 2.3 (15/15 points) Comparison:
	(5/5 points): Discusses each algorithm
	(5/5 points): Discusses runtimes
	(5/5 points): Discusses something other than runtime

-well done!
