as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put beside his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart
so i for fear of trust forget to say
the perfect ceremony of loves rite
and in mine own loves strength seem to decay
oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might 
o let my looks be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more expressed
o learn to read what silent love hath writ
to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit
