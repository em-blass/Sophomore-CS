(20/20) code compiles
(10/10) code is clean and readable
(10/10) code reads in from file 
(10/10) code parses lines into structs
(10/10) code stores structs in array (properly handling size increment)
(15/20) logic for sales is good (10 points for checking if a selling item can be sold 10 points for checking if a buying item can be bought)
-some logic is there but not all the way
(5/10) removes items from array properly
-some elements removed from array
(5/10) correct output
